Syntax and important key points 
1> FileInputstream sn = new FileInputStream(abc.txt)
The read is use to read the bnytes in the file  . 
In the file that has the character and if we are using the command for the int then we will surely get the ascii values of the file . 

Using the int , then surely wee will get the character ASCII code and not the character itself . 


Dynamic reading of data :
to get the dynamic reading of the data we can use the for / while loop  , at the end of the file the read returns hte -1 as the numeric value . 
synatx for the dyanmic reading of the data
****
i = fis.read(); 
while(i!=-1)
{system.out.println(data);}
****

The data stored inside the variable or the file is lost after the whole prorgam exectuion  . 

wrriting to the file make a output stream connection . 

how does the write method work in the byte connection , use we use this as if we write the write(5) the 5->101 the wrtiteen to the file . 

fileoutputstream ms = new fileoutputstream("New.txt") ;
ms.write() ;
ms.close() ;
the class or the method wehere this ab9ovbe statement are written then the IOstreamException is includeed and is intended ot throw  . 

if the vacent file is not created then the file not found exception is generated . 

Dynamic copying of one file into the other file :
Data is avauible in one file f1 and we wish to copy the data into other file named file2  , this is called the dyncmaic copying of the data . 

form data one -> java file -> textfile writing .
Connection making 
1>make the read connection using the java appplication by making a fileinput . 
2> make the writer methodf with the constrcutopr as the string in the write mehtod to the text file where we wish to make the dynamic copying  . 


Add the exception and the possible try and catch for the robustness  of the code  .

Several expections are covered using the comma seperation  .
