Unified modelling language
The is a daigram based model use to make project layout . 
These are divided into 2 type: 
1> Bhevaourial 
2> Structural

Behvourial diagrams :

class diagram : These has different class and the object and used to show the various static realation between the class and the objects .

Components diagrma :
This is used to show how different smaller componnent are put togther to from bigger components and hence , used in the whole system deployments  , These has the source code components , executable componnets etc . 

Deployment diagram :
This is used to show th system architectue as the deployment . example the client and the server networks .
These has the artifects , which show muiltiple object in the real world .
These diagram is used in the overall development  .

Object diagram :
This is the instance of the class diagram, used to show the detailed snapshot of the system state at a particualr point of the time  .

The main difference in the class and the object is thta the objt is a specific diafgram and the class diagram is a abstract one 
 .


Package diagram : Use to show packagesd and the dependenciras between the them , used to displayu the different biew of  the systems . 


composite diagram
similar to class diagram 
sort of a component diagram  .
this is used int eh mirco level systems 
This is also called as the static structure diagram used to show the partts only.
specifivally the internal strucuttres .
uses the connectors between teh components  .
