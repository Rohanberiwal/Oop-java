Dynamic file copying operation in Java 
There is hardcoding data for the data transfer form the p.txt to q.txt file Usaully .
The soucre file has to be read and the source file should not be hardcoded .  
The file name input has to be tacken form the keyboad or from the i/o device . 
Take the input for the file destionation and the file output stream using the scanner or any other method  . 
There are intotal 7 wasy to take the user input .


Ways to take input form the user  : 
1> Console as the commandline 
2> Nuffer reader approach 
3> Console 
4> Scanner class import
5> GUI using the javaFX  or stuff similar to that 
6> System approach 

case -1 :

java file copy arg[0] arg[1]
 

fileInputStream ms = new FileInputStream(arg[0]);
fileOuputStream msn  = new File Ouput Stream(args[1])  ;

The file in the both of these should be present explicity ,and these should be defined .
The file your are entriering has to be there in teh directory  .
The code for the copying a gile into other file we can use the Filecopy part .

filecopy fileCop.Java p.txt . 
How does the above statement work >
The filecopy is a use to copy the content of the fisrst file to the other file .
The java file content arte copied to the text file .

The two main things to keep in mind :
1> Must pass the file from the cmd line 
2> src file must be there physically .

The destination file is created by the fos object automatically , so no need to create  . 
FileNotFound exception  has to be handled ayt each step .  
File not found is a checked exeception and it extends i/o excepton .
adding the import statement of java is very important .

The checked expcetion is a complie time error , to it is basciallty a error not a exceptioon but it comes wiht the name of the exception . 

Inside the diretopry the files are there , this is a mandatory operation  , the file should be there .
Inside the directory if the file is not there then the file not found exception  is there  . 
Files permsission are also should be granted so that the user can  use them .


FNFE is a expection is a complie time error and it is a  checked excpetion that has to be handled .

When the file ascess is denied then the output stream is not able find the file and the gives the file permsssion not ghranted error . 


when do u get the file not found ecception :
1> when the file is not there 
2>whent the file is a directory 
3> file is not in the same direcotory .


fileNotFound Exception with fis object :
when does the file not found exception  occue with the object oyutput stream :
1> when the file name is not avaible .
2> file is availaible but it is not regular file  , rather than a direcotory  .
3> file is availaible but reading , are not availaible. 

fileNotFoundException in the fos object  :
if unable to creatr the file 
if the file is availiable as directory and npt as regular file rather then a directory .
no writing permissions. 

the file writing in the c drive , then the permission denied error will be given or file not found exception .
fileOutputStream constructor gives a permission denied error when the file is unable to ascessed . 
the expceiton of the file not found is availaible is when the the file is present but the ascess is denied . 


file not found is a important checked exception .
