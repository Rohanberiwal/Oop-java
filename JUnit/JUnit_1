JUnit 

This is used for the testing part . 
Why do we testing ?
>Designing 
>Write code
>Test 
>Run the Test 
The point of the junit testing means that the code works for the future also and not only for the starting this, period .
	
Why is there a need for the testing framework ?
To minimize the differencer in the expected and the got value , one of the value is reciveved and other value is the  value that ,we test on . 

How to run the test ?
Step :
1> Perpreations 
2>Povide the inputs
2> Run the test 
3>Expceted outputs 
4>Verify result .
5> Do somehting for the test recovery .  
@Test annotation is used top test the code . 
the method name is the Test() always and never any other method .


Obseravtion :
1> Mark test annotations 
2>This is used to give  a mark to the engine about how the test is going to happen . 

Junut provide api for the repeated checking and testing . 
There are  3 different API for the unit checking . 

Lifecycle -> Junit 
Phases of the lifeCycle :
1>Before All 
2> Before Each
3> Test
$>After each 
5> After all
befroe is used for the initilaisation hase and the part checking . 
The afterll part is used for the cleanup and the tasks for the tests 

These abopve are bascically  the annotation that is used to run the program while the phases are just the form in thet annontatations.

Caonditional exectuion based exectuion of the jUnit tests

There are two parts in teh conditional operation execution 
1>EnabledOnOS
2> DisabledOnOS
Theya re again the annotation ans are the marker to the compiler .

Assmptions 
These are the asummption marker taken for the sucess full exectuioon of og the prorgram . 

Repeated test annotations 
This is used when there is functionality with the randomness 
Used for the repated execution of the program again and again  . 
Substuites for the Test annotations.

Parameterized test in the JUnit :
THese are similar to the repeated test but the differnce is that they have different parameter or the different inputs everytime .
To use the parameterizesd source annotation used is : @	Value SOURCE nnotation . 
In this aboe annotation the value is passed as the paramterts inside the constructors . 

The second annotation is the parameterzied source -> source Annotation .

The third and the last one is the nested test  :
@nested is the annotation used in this . 
In this bforceALL and the after all is not used anywhere only the after each and the before each is  used .
