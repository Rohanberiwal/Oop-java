Static nested classes 
Sometimes we can declare inner class wiht the static modifier , hence this is called as static nested classes .
Withthe existance of the outer class there is neraly no chance of the exisitance of the static varibale of the class declared  . 

class Outer
{
 class Inner{}
}

Here since the inner class is non static then the inner class ahs the non static refracne  or the instance refraance  . 

In the the static class object there may be a chance of the exisitance of the object that is deifned inside the class as the static refrance  , however the object that has the non static context or the instance of context , those are impossible to exisit without the outer class object .

The Inner class object is strongly associated witht the outer class object  that is why this Innenr class with the outer clasas is called as the nested class object  . 

Hence the static nestedc class object is not 
strongly assocaited with the outer class object , that is why there is the use of the word nested  .
