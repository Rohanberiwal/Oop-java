I/O streams Classes 
soruce -> java app -> sink 
Source : file , keyboard , i/o hardware , sockets , network computer  . 
Java app : Normal code
Sink : network computer , sink , file . array , data strcuture etc 

Source  : Input stream  class object 
Sink  : output stream class object 

Standard Naming convention for the subclass Naming 
subclass name  : operation name + superclass name
The two main input stream that exist for the sink file and the socket are :
1> File Input stream 
2> Socket Input stream 
 
For the class of the input and the output streams is :
1> interface 
2> abstract class 
3> concreate class

inputstream class is a abstract class
outputstream class is the absrtact class 

read() and the write() is  abstract method and not any implemented method 

Important points :
1>input and the output streams ahs several subclasses 
2>becasue of many source to read the data and many sources to write the data
3> read and the write are the abstract method in the abstract classes input stream and the output stream  .

java.lang.Object -> Input stream  ->so on ....


Input stream : closable interface
1> fileInput stream 
2> Byte array data stream 
3> FilteInput data stream :subclass 
 ->1>Data input stream class 
 ->2> Buffered input stream class
 ->3> Line number input stream 
 ->4> Push back data stream
4>Object input stream 
5>Piped Input stream
6> Sequence Input stream 
7> String buffer input stream

Input stream implements the closable interface 
The autoclosable is very useful for the auto closing the input stream and this is a interface .
